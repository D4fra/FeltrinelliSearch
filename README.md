In this project I try to recreate the search page and the page of product of the app Feltrinelli.
So my goal is to create a functional SearchBar in the most simple way.   
For creatin its I use SwiftUI and SwiftFile.
I use SwfitUI for all the graphic part, instead I use SwiftFile for creating the databse that contains the information of the product.
I hope that this project be useful to learn new things for everyone. Thanks to everyone trying it 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
